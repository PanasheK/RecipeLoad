# AWS Configuration File Explanation

The `aws-config.js` file in the `src` directory is currently not working as intended. This file is crucial for configuring the AWS services used in your application. Here's an explanation of the issue and how to fix it:

## Current Status

The file contains placeholder values instead of actual AWS configuration details. Here's what needs to be updated:

1. `region`: Replace "YOUR_REGION" with your actual AWS region (e.g., "us-east-1").
2. `userPoolId`: Replace "YOUR_USER_POOL_ID" with your Cognito User Pool ID.
3. `userPoolWebClientId`: Replace "YOUR_CLIENT_ID" with your Cognito App Client ID.
4. `bucket`: Replace "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX" with your S3 bucket name.
5. `identityPoolId`: Replace "YOUR_IDENTITY_POOL_ID" with your Cognito Identity Pool ID.
6. `endpoint`: Replace "YOUR_API_GATEWAY_URL" with your actual API Gateway URL.

## How to Fix

To make the `aws-config.js` file work correctly, you need to replace these placeholder values with your actual AWS configuration details. Here's an example of how the file should look after updating (with fictional values):

```javascript
const awsConfig = {
  Auth: {
    region: "us-east-1",
    userPoolId: "us-east-1_abcdefgh",
    userPoolWebClientId: "1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j",
  },
  Storage: {
    region: "us-east-1",
    bucket: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    identityPoolId: "us-east-1:12345678-abcd-efgh-ijkl-123456789012",
  },
  API: {
    endpoints: [
      {
        name: "recipes",
        endpoint: "https://api1234567.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod",
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

## Next Steps

1. Locate your AWS configuration details from the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the `aws-config.js` file in your project.
3. Replace each placeholder value with the corresponding actual value from your AWS setup.
4. Save the file and test your application to ensure it can now connect to your AWS services.

Remember to keep your AWS configuration details secure and never commit them to version control. Consider using environment variables or a secure configuration management system for production deployments.
